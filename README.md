# fuuleaHD_MDM_Bypass
*A cracker version which allow you to use it withou LinspirerMDM  : )*
## Features
Bypass LinspirerMDM and root detection.So you don't need to install the annoying LinspirerMDM and take efforts to hide su ~~even though it just check whether the su file exists~~.
## Hardware compatibility
This app can **only** work on **ARM devices** because it only has arm libraries! My experiment proves that the x86 android simulators can't convert these arm codes to x86 codes!
